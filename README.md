# Home-Sales-Transactions
This project implements a comprehensive database system for managing home sales transactions. Built using SQL, it simulates a real-world scenario of property listings, buyers, sellers, and realtors interacting in a dynamic real estate market.
Key features include:
Tables for Properties, Buyers, Sellers, Realtors, and Bid History
Detailed property information and comprehensive bid history tracking
The system incorporates complex SQL queries for valuable insights and includes advanced triggers:
Ensures bid dates are not earlier than property listing dates
Prevents conflicts of interest by ensuring buyer and seller realtors are different
Maintains competitive bidding by ensuring new bids are higher than the current lowest bid
A stored procedure retrieves highest bidder information for a given property.
This project demonstrates proficiency in database design, SQL querying, and implementing business logic through triggers and stored procedures, showcasing real-world application of database management principles.
